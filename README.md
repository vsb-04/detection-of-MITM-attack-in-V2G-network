# Detection of MITM Attacks in V2G Networks

This project implements a machine learning-based solution to detect **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attacks in **Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)** communication networks. V2G systems enable bidirectional power flow and communication between electric vehicles (EVs) and the smart grid, which makes them potential targets for cyber attacks such as MITM. This project demonstrates how such attacks can be detected using supervised learning techniques.
